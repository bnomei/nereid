# Mermaid ASCII README fixtures

Source:
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexanderGrooff/mermaid-ascii/refs/heads/master/README.md`

Notes:
- These fixtures are copied from the upstream README to act as a real-world corpus for:
  - feature-coverage/parsing tests
  - future “feature parity” tests (kept as TODO/ignored for now)
  - Criterion performance benches
- Variants that only change **padding/spacing** (e.g. `-x`, `-p`, `--ascii`) are intentionally not included.
